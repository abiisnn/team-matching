<p>Team Matching is a project in which we aim to help to create optimal teams, considering multiple factors like skills, diversity, knowledge and personality.<br>
We got inspired by Competitive Programming, because the creation of new teams is a challenge since we are all are different.</p>
<h3 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h3>
<p>This project was made for a Hackathon called " <a href="http://www.digitalagehack.com">Digital Age Hackathon</a>", for the challenge of Psychotechnologies.</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>We encourage the teams to have different skills and knowledges, because this allows them to share their abilities while they cover a wide-range of skills.</p>

<p>We use the personality test of <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16 personalities</a> (for reasons of time and ignorance about the most advanced studies in the field) to obtain the personality of each person; We include all this within an app to answer the personality questionnaire, as well as to answer about the abilities that each person considers to have. These desired skills are configured in the manager dashboard to designate which skills are important to him regarding what type of team he wants to train.</p>
