<p>Team Matching is a project in which we aim to help create optimal teams, considering multiple factors like skills, diversity, knowledge and personality.<br>
We got inspired by Competitive Programming, because the creation of new teams is a challenge since we all are different.</p>
<h3 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h3>
<p>This project was made for a Hackathon called " <a href="http://www.digitalagehack.com">Digital Age Hackathon</a>", for the challenge of Psychotechnologies.</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>We encourage teams to have different skills and knowledge, because this allows them to share their abilities while they cover a wide-range of skills.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>We use the personality test of <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16 personalities</a> (for the lack of time and resources to develop our own algorithm we decided to use their system and only take the results of their test into our software) to obtain the personality of each person; We included all this within an app to answer the personality questionnaire, as well as to know about the abilities that each person considers to have. These desired skills are configured in the manager dashboard to designate which skills are important to them regarding what type of team they want to train.</p>

<p>Some of the development things we implemented here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Manipulation</li>
<li>Find Antichains</li>
<li>Brute Force</li>
<li>Build graph</li>
<li>Dilworth theorem</li>
<li>Bipartite Matching</li>
<li>Vertex Cover</li>
<li>Maximum Antichain</li>
<li>Personality  Matching</li>
</ul>

<p>The team was integrated by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/abiisnn">Abigail </a> (Her ICPC team was #include&lt;witech&gt;)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/equetzal">Enya </a> (Her ICPC team was Vaporub.exe)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/searleser97">Sergio </a> (His ICPC team was 404. Globito not found)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shadowmimo">Ulises</a> (His ICPC team was Error. “Team Name” not defined.)</li>
</ul>
<p>So we combined all our ICPC team names to get</p>
